# Lung cancer prediction using Machine Learning

Cancer is considered to be the second leading cause of death in the world. This is caused due to the abnormal growth of cells having the potential to spread all over the body. Lung cancer is caused by the uncontrolled cell growth in the tissues of the lungs and this is the one causing more deaths. People with lung cancer can experience pain in the chest, frequent respiratory infections, shortness of breath, wheezing, weakness or weight loss. It initially starts in the cells lining the bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli. The two major types of lung cancer are non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. An early detection of lung cancer leads to a successful treatment thereby reducing the death rate.

Thus we can prevent lung cancer by predicting them in the early stage which can be possible by using good data-driven systems and therefore making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is possible using machine learning as it is been gradually accepted in the field of healthcare. Diagnosis of disease is one of the chief applications of machine learning.
